# BayesMixedLogit
This is a repository for sharing basic stata code and workbooks describing Bayesian estimation of a mixed logit model. If you want a presentation of an example interlaced with theory, start with [the Jupyter Workbook](/BayesMixedLogit.ipynb). The raw Stata code, without any explanation, is [here](/BayesMixedLogit.do). 

Please feel free to comment or criticise using [Issues](https://github.com/mbaker21231/BayesMixedLogit/issues).
